# Juice Up - Don't wait just charge 

Do you own an EV car? That's great for the environment but how is the car charging coming along.
Have you waited in line to charge your car at the stations. Here is a solution that gives you real time availability of charging stations near you. The good part is that you don't have to figure it out , your smart car will do it for you.

We are looking at a tremendous growth in the connected cars technology in the coming years. Cars currently send out data about their location, ignition, charge level, speed ,etc. This project's focus is on charging your car with minimum wait time at the charging stations using real time data from a network on charging stations and location data from connected cars.
